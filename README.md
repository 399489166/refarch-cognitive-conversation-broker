This project offers a set of simple APIs in front of Watson Conversation to be consumed by your web interface, mobile app  or business process defined in BPM on Cloud. The project includes an angular 2 web application to illustrate a simple conversation front end.
The project is designed as a micro service and deployable as a Cloud Foundry application. The concept of broker is presented in the IBM Cognitive Reference Architecture for Engagement and Discovery as illustrated in the figure below:
