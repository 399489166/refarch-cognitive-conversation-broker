# Conversation tutorial

In this tutorial you will implement a simple help-me conversation in the context of Case Inc, which  is a medium size retail company, where employees access a set of intranet business applications. The support director wants to modernize the way to support internal staff and offload his team from basic work. Currently 20000 tickets are issued in a year. 50% of the calls are answered in 7 minutes whereas there are many situations that reach up to 70 minutes for resolution. 92% of the calls are resolved by level 1 support. Employees of the Case Inc engage with customer support mostly through phones. Today, call center agents struggle to find some of the answers in a timely fashion as the systems are not integrated. This results in loss of productivity and frustration on the part of the bank employees. Level 1 support team get frustrated at times because of unavailability of the right information and proper guidance. The Level 1 support has to consult the Level 2 support team members to get some answers.   

As presented in the [Watson Conversation reference architecture diagram](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/content/architecture/cognitiveArchitecture) this tutorial addresses the Ground Truth development (3), the conversation flow design and the run time processing (4) from a business application simple interface (9).
